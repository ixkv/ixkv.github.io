## What Is Yield Farming?  

Yield farming involves **locking cryptocurrencies into liquidity pools or staking protocols** to generate passive income. For stablecoins‚Äîdigital assets pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar‚Äîthis strategy offers reduced volatility while still delivering substantial returns. By leveraging decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, investors can earn interest rates far exceeding traditional banking products.  

### Why Stablecoins?  
Stablecoins like USDC, USDT, DAI, and BUSD combine the benefits of blockchain technology with price stability. This makes them ideal for yield farming, as investors avoid the price swings associated with Bitcoin or Ethereum while capitalizing on high annual percentage yields (APYs).
