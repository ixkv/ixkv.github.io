## Trading Strategies for HUMA Perpetual Contracts  

### Leverage Utilization  
With a **maximum 20x leverage**, traders can amplify gains (and losses). For example:  
- A $100 USDT position with 10x leverage controls $1,000 worth of HUMA exposure.  
- Recommended for experienced traders due to amplified volatility risks.  

### Funding Fee Implications  
The dynamic funding mechanism ensures perpetual contract prices track spot markets. Traders should:  
- Monitor the **4-hour funding intervals** to anticipate costs.  
- Use arbitrage opportunities during funding rate resets.  

## Market Context and HUMA Token Overview

Its integration into OKXâ€™s perpetual contracts reflects growing institutional interest in AI-driven blockchain solutions. Traders can now hedge against HUMAâ€™s price volatility or speculate on its adoption growth.
