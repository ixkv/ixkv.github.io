## 1. Understanding Bitcoin: The Digital Gold

Bitcoin (BTC) is a decentralized digital currency introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 and launched in 2009. Utilizing blockchain technology, Bitcoin eliminates the need for centralized intermediaries by recording transactions on a distributed ledger. Its most notable feature is its capped supply of 21 million coins, a design choice that creates scarcity and positions Bitcoin as "digital gold" within the crypto ecosystem.

### Why Bitcoin Matters  
- **Decentralization**: Operates without central authority, ensuring transparency and security.  
- **Scarcity**: Fixed supply drives long-term value potential.  
- **Global Adoption**: Increasingly integrated into mainstream finance and commerce.
