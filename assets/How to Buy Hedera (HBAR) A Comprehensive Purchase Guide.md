### Step 2: Complete Identity Verification  
Most exchanges require Know Your Customer (KYC) verification to comply with regulatory standards. Prepare documents like:  
- Government-issued ID (passport or driver's license)  
- Proof of address (utility bill or bank statement)  
- Selfie verification for biometric confirmation  

This process typically takes 24â€“48 hours and ensures compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations.  

### Step 3: Deposit Funds  
After verification, fund your account using:  
- Bank transfers (ACH or SWIFT)  
- Credit/debit cards (Visa/Mastercard)  
- Cryptocurrency deposits (BTC, ETH, etc.)  

Processing times varyâ€”bank transfers may take 1â€“3 business days, while card payments are instant.  

### Step 4: Execute Your HBAR Purchase  
Navigate to the HBAR trading pair section and choose:  
- **Market Order**: Buy immediately at current prices  
- **Limit Order**: Set a target price for purchase  

Confirm the transaction details and complete your purchase.  

### Step 5: Secure Your HBAR Holdings  
Store HBAR in:  
- **Exchange Wallet**: Convenient but riskier for large holdings  
- **Hardware Wallet**: Cold storage for long-term security (e.g., Ledger, Trezor)  
- **Software Wallet**: Mobile/desktop apps with enhanced accessibility
