## How to Transfer Cryptocurrency to Tangem Wallet  

To securely transfer digital assets to your **Tangem Wallet**, follow these steps:  

1. Open the Tangem app and navigate to the wallet homepage.  
2. Tap the three dots in the top-right corner and select the desired wallet.  
3. Go to **Manage tokens** and search for the cryptocurrency you want to receive.  
4. Enable the network associated with the token (e.g., Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain).  
5. Generate your wallet address by tapping **Receive**.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Tip**: Always verify that the sender‚Äôs network matches your wallet‚Äôs network. Mismatched networks can lead to irreversible fund loss.  

### Example: Receiving ETH vs. WETH  
If you withdraw ETH from an exchange to your **Tangem Wallet** but select a non-Ethereum network, you‚Äôll receive **Wrapped Ethereum (WETH)** instead. This occurs because ETH is wrapped to operate outside its native network.

## Selecting the Correct Network for Transfers  

Ensure seamless transactions by aligning networks on both sender and recipient ends:  

1. Open the Tangem app and access **Manage tokens**.  
2. Locate the cryptocurrency and expand its network options.  
3. Enable the network used by the sender (e.g., Arbitrum, Polygon).  

üîç **Key Insight**: Many tokens exist on multiple networks (e.g., USDT on TRON vs. Ethereum). Always cross-check network details before initiating a transfer.  

---

## Custom Token Support for Unsupported Networks  

If your preferred token isn‚Äôt listed in **Manage tokens**, you can add it manually:  

**Supported Networks**: ApeChain, Arbitrum, Aurora, Avalanche, BNB Smart Chain, and over 50 more.  

**Steps to Add a Custom Token**:  
1. Gather the token‚Äôs contract address (via [CoinMarketCap](https://www.coinmarketcap.com/)).  
2. Access **Manage tokens** > **+** icon > Input the contract details.  
3. Verify decimals and network to avoid errors.

## Resolving Common Transfer Issues  

### XRP or XLM Balance Appears Short by 1 Unit  
The **Stellar** and **XRPL** blockchains reserve 1 XRP/XLM to activate accounts. For example, sending 10 XRP will reflect 9 XRP spendable balance.  

### ‚ÄúAccount Not Created‚Äù Error  
This occurs if the minimum reserve (1 XRP/XLM) isn‚Äôt met. Deposit additional funds to activate the account.  

### ‚ÄúInvalid Address‚Äù Errors  
Ensure network compatibility between sender and recipient. Mismatched networks (e.g., sending BEP-20 tokens to an ERC-20 address) trigger this error.

## Transaction Fees and Network Costs  

### Understanding Network Fees  
Tangem doesn‚Äôt charge transaction fees. Costs depend on:  
- **Network congestion**: Higher demand increases fees.  
- **Transaction speed**: Prioritize fees for faster confirmations.  

**Fee Levels**: Low, Normal, or Priority (set in the Tangem app).  

### Network-Specific Fee Structures  
| Network               | Native Coin for Fees | Average Fee (USD) |  
|-----------------------|----------------------|-------------------|  
| Ethereum              | ETH                  | $1‚Äì$15            |  
| BNB Smart Chain       | BNB                  | <$0.10             |  
| Solana                | SOL                  | <$0.01             |  
| Arbitrum              | Arbitrum ETH         | <$0.50             |  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Tip**: Always hold the native network coin (e.g., BNB for BSC) to cover fees.

## Troubleshooting Unreceived Funds  

### 1. Blockchain Delays  
Check the transaction ID (txID) in a blockchain explorer. Delays occur due to:  
- **Low sender fees**: Transactions with low fees may take hours to confirm.  
- **Network congestion**: Ethereum often experiences delays during high demand.  

### 2. Address or Network Errors  
Verify the recipient address and network match exactly. Even a single character discrepancy can result in loss.  

### 3. Unsupported Networks  
If funds arrive on an unsupported network (e.g., Optimism), they‚Äôll remain inaccessible until Tangem adds support.

## Advanced Features and Best Practices  

### SegWit vs. Legacy Addresses  
- **SegWit (Default)**: Reduces fees by 30‚Äì40% and speeds up transactions.

### Managing Multiple Addresses  
All addresses in Tangem remain static unless you reset your wallet. Never share private keys or seed phrases.  

### Transaction Confirmation Times  
| Network       | Average Confirmation Time |  
|---------------|----------------------------|  
| Bitcoin       | 10‚Äì60 minutes              |  
| Ethereum      | 1‚Äì15 minutes               |  
| Solana        | 2‚Äì5 seconds                |  
| Polygon       | 2‚Äì10 minutes               |
