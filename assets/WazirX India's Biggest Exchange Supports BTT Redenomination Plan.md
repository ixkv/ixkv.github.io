# WazirX: India's Biggest Exchange Supports BTT Redenomination Plan  

Indiaâ€™s largest cryptocurrency exchange, WazirX, has officially endorsed the BitTorrent redenomination, token migration, and renaming initiative. This move aligns with broader industry efforts to streamline blockchain ecosystems and enhance user experience. Below, we explore the details of this transition, its implications for traders, and the broader context of WazirXâ€™s role in the crypto landscape.  

## Understanding the BTT Redenomination Process  

The redenomination plan involves converting existing **BTT tokens** into a new token called **BTTC** at a ratio of **1 BTT (OLD) = 1,000 BTTC**. Key steps include:  

- **Token Delisting**: WazirX suspended BTT deposits and withdrawals on January 17, 2022, and delisted **BTT/USDT** and **BTT/INR** trading pairs.  
- **Token Swap**: Eligible users received BTTC credits proportional to their BTT holdings.  
- **Rebranding**: Old BTT tokens were renamed to **BTTOLD**, while the new BTTC token became the standard.  
- **Trading Resumption**: BTTC/USDT and BTTC/INR pairs launched on January 21, 2022, at 4:00 PM IST.  

This transition aims to improve scalability and utility within the **BitTorrent Chain ecosystem**, where BTTC will serve as the native token for governance, staking, and transaction fees.  

### Why Redenominate?  

Token redenomination often addresses practical challenges such as:  
- **Fractional Value Management**: High token supplies (e.g., billions of BTT) complicate transactions. Reducing the supply makes transfers and pricing more efficient.  
- **User Experience**: Simplified denominations align with mainstream financial practices, reducing errors in trading and accounting.  
- **Ecosystem Growth**: A restructured token can better support decentralized applications (dApps) and validator networks.  

## WazirXâ€™s Role in Cryptocurrency Ecosystems  

Founded in 2018 by Nischal Shetty, **WazirX** has grown to serve over **7.3 million users**, offering trading for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and TRX. Acquired by **Binance in 2019**, the exchange leverages global infrastructure to provide fiat-to-crypto gateways and robust security.  

### Key Features of WazirX  
- **High Liquidity**: Supports millions of transactions per second.  
- **Native Utility Token**: The **WRX token** (max supply: 1 billion) facilitates trading fee discounts and governance.  
- **TRX Integration**: TRONâ€™s native token (TRX) ranks among the platformâ€™s most traded assets.  

WazirXâ€™s support for the BTT redenomination underscores its commitment to adopting blockchain innovations that benefit users.  

## BitTorrentâ€™s Evolution Under TRON Foundation  

BitTorrent, acquired by TRON Foundation in 2018, remains the largest decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing protocol. Its transition to **BTTC** reflects TRONâ€™s vision of integrating decentralized storage with blockchain technology.  

### Applications of BTTC  
- **Validator Participation**: Users can stake BTTC to secure the network and earn rewards.  
- **Governance**: Token holders vote on protocol upgrades and ecosystem decisions.  
- **Gas Fees**: BTTC serves as the native currency for transaction costs on the BitTorrent Chain.  

The migration to BTTC, completed by January 12, 2022, was supported by exchanges like **Binance, Bibox, and Bithumb**, signaling widespread industry acceptance.  

## Implications for Traders and Investors  

The redenomination impacts stakeholders in several ways:  

- **Price Volatility**: Sudden shifts in token supply can influence market dynamics. Traders should monitor BTTCâ€™s post-launch performance.  
- **Wallet Compatibility**: Users must ensure their wallets support BTTC to avoid losing access to funds.  
- **Tax Considerations**: Token swaps may have regulatory implications depending on jurisdiction.  

### FAQ: Addressing Common Concerns  

**Q: What happens to my BTT holdings after the migration?**  
A: Eligible users automatically receive BTTC at the 1:1000 ratio. Old BTT tokens are rebranded as BTTOLD.  

**Q: Can I still trade BTTOLD?**  
A: Most exchanges have phased out BTTOLD. Check WazirX or Bitbns for specific timelines.  

**Q: Why did BitTorrent rebrand to BTTC?**  
A: The rebrand simplifies token economics and aligns with TRONâ€™s long-term scalability goals.  

**Q: How does BTTC benefit the BitTorrent ecosystem?**  
A: It enhances staking rewards, governance participation, and network security.
