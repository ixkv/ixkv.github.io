# Grass Crypto Airdrop Guide: How to Claim $GRASS Tokens and Earn Rewards

The Grass Network has launched its groundbreaking **Grass Crypto Airdrop**, marking a pivotal moment in decentralized internet development. This initiative empowers users worldwide to collectively control web infrastructure through innovative bandwidth-sharing technology. The $GRASS token lies at the heart of this ecosystem, offering unprecedented opportunities for participation in decentralized governance and network rewards.

## Understanding the Grass Network Ecosystem

Grass Network represents a revolutionary approach to internet infrastructure, creating the first user-owned map of the internet.

The $GRASS token serves as both governance mechanism and transaction medium within this ecosystem, with token holders gaining:

- Voting rights in network development decisions
- Opportunities to stake tokens for passive rewards
- Access to decentralized web data services

### Airdrop One: Largest Token Distribution in Web3 History

The inaugural **Grass Crypto Airdrop** will distribute 100 million GRASS tokens (10% of total supply) to early adopters. This historic event rewards contributors who helped build the network's foundation through bandwidth provision and node operation.

#### Distribution Breakdown:
