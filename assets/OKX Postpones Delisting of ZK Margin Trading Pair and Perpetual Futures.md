## Delisting Schedule Overview  

The revised schedule for ZK-related trading products is as follows:  

### Perpetual Futures Trading  

| Futures Name | Updated Delisting Time (UTC) |  
|--------------|-----------------------------|  
| ZK/USDT      | June 6, 2024, 8:00 AM UTC   |  

### Margin Trading  

| Margin Trading Pair | Borrowing Cease Time (UTC) | Final Delisting Time (UTC) |  
|---------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|  
| ZK/USDT             | May 31, 2024, 6:00 AM UTC | June 5, 2024, 6:00 AMâ€“2:00 PM UTC |  

**Key Implications**:  
- Open margin orders will be canceled during the delisting window.  
- Suspension processes for each pair may take up to one hour.  
- Users holding borrowed ZK/USDT positions must repay loans before deadlines to avoid forced liquidation.  

## Critical Adjustments for Users  

### Forced Repayment Mechanism  

Unpaid borrowings at the time of delisting will trigger automatic repayment. This process prioritizes risk management for the platform but could expose users to market volatility.

### Price Volatility Warning  

Market prices for ZK may experience extreme fluctuations during the delisting period. Users are advised to:  
1. Close open positions in advance.  
2. Withdraw collateral holdings promptly.  
3. Avoid initiating new trades for ZK pairs.  

## Discount Rate Modifications  

OKX has revised its discount rate structure for ZK margin trading:  

| Crypto | Pre-Adjustment Tiers (USD) | Pre-Adjustment Discount Rate | Post-Adjustment Tiers (USD) | Post-Adjustment Discount Rate |  
|--------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|  
| ZK     | 0â€“50,000                  | 0.5                         | 0                          | 0                            |  
| ZK     | >50,000                   | 0                           | N/A                        | N/A                          |  

This change eliminates preferential rates for ZK holdings below $50,000, aligning with broader risk mitigation strategies.
